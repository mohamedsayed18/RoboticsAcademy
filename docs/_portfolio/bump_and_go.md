The intention of this excersise is to program a basic behavior of bump-spin using a Finite State Machine. For that, we will use the VisualStates tool, that allows you to create your own states machine in an intuitive way.

There is a Kobuki robot inside a labyrinth or scenario. The robot will go front until it gets close to an obstacle. The it will go back, turn a random angle and go front again repeating the process. This exercise aims to show the power of automata when building robot behavior.

Using the JdeRobot [VisualStates tool](https://jderobot.github.io/VisualStates) the solution works like this. The tool's detailed manual, installation instructions, etc. can be found [here](https://jderobot.github.io/VisualStates).
