The goal of this exercise is to implement the logic that allows a quadrotor to play a game of cat and mouse with a second quadrotor.

In this exercise, the cat quadrotor has to be programmed by the student to follow the mouse quadrotor (which is preprogrammed and moves randomly) as close as possible without crashing. The refree application will measure the distance between the two drones and will assign a score based on the time spent by the drones close to each other.

## Requirements

As this is a drones exercise, you will need to additionally install the `jderobot-assets`, `dronewrapper` and `rqt_drone_teleop` packages. These can be installed as

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-drone-wrapper ros-melodic-rqt-drone-teleop ros-melodic-jderobot-assets
```

There is an additional dependency on MAVROS and PX4 that you can fulfill following the [Drones installation instructions](/RoboticsAcademy/installation/#specific-infrastructure).

## How to run

To launch the exercise, simply use the following command from this directory:

```bash
roslaunch drone_cat_mouse.launch
```

## How to do the practice

To solve the exercise, you must edit the `my_solution.py` file and insert the control logic into it.

## Where to insert the code

Your code has to be entered in the `execute` function between the `Insert your code` here comments.

my_solution.py

```python
def execute(event):
  global drone
  img_frontal = drone.get_frontal_image()
  img_ventral = drone.get_ventral_image()
  # Both the above images are cv2 images
  ################# Insert your code here #################################

  set_image_filtered(img_frontal)
  set_image_threshed(img_ventral)

  #########################################################################
```

## API

* `set_image_filtered(cv2_image)` - If you want to show a filtered image of the camera images in the GUI
* `set_image_threshed(cv2_image)` - If you want to show a thresholded image in the GUI
* `drone.get_frontal_image()` - Returns the latest image from the frontal camera as a cv2_image
* `drone.get_ventral_image()` - Returns the latest image from the ventral camera as a cv2_image
* `drone.get_position()` - Returns the position of the drone as a numpy array [x, y, z]
* `drone.get_orientation()` - Returns the roll, pitch and yaw of the drone as a numpy array [roll, pitch, yaw]
* `drone.get_roll()` - Returns the roll of the drone
* `drone.get_pitch()` - Returns the pitch of the drone
* `drone.get_yaw()` - Returns the yaw of the drone
* `drone.set_cmd_vel(vx, vy, vz, az)` - Commands the linear velocity of the drone in the x, y and z directions and the angular velocity in z in its body fixed frame
