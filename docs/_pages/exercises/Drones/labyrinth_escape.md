The goal of this exercise is to implement the logic that allows a quadrotor to escape a labyrinth through visual signals placed on the ground.

{% include gallery caption="Gallery." %}

## Requirements

As this is a drones exercise, you will need to additionally install the `jderobot-assets`, `dronewrapper` and `rqt_drone_teleop` packages. These can be installed as

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-drone-wrapper ros-melodic-rqt-drone-teleop ros-melodic-jderobot-assets
```

There is an additional dependency on MAVROS and PX4 that you can fulfill following the [Drones installation instructions](/RoboticsAcademy/installation/#specific-infrastructure).

## How to run

To launch the exercise, simply use the following command from this directory:

```bash
roslaunch labyrinth_escape.launch
```

## How to do the practice

To solve the exercise, you must edit the `my_solution.py` file and insert the control logic into it.

## Where to insert the code

Your code has to be entered in the `execute` function between the `Insert your code` here comments.

my_solution.py

```python
def execute(event):
  global drone
  img_frontal = drone.get_frontal_image()
  img_ventral = drone.get_ventral_image()
  # Both the above images are cv2 images
  ################# Insert your code here #################################

  set_image_filtered(img_frontal)
  set_image_threshed(img_ventral)

#########################################################################
```

## API

* `set_image_filtered(cv2_image)` - If you want to show a filtered image of the camera images in the GUI
* `set_image_threshed(cv2_image)` - If you want to show a thresholded image in the GUI
* `drone.get_frontal_image()` - Returns the latest image from the frontal camera as a cv2_image
* `drone.get_ventral_image()` - Returns the latest image from the ventral camera as a cv2_image
* `drone.get_position()` - Returns the position of the drone as a numpy array [x, y, z]
* `drone.get_orientation()` - Returns the roll, pitch and yaw of the drone as a numpy array [roll, pitch, yaw]
* `drone.get_roll()` - Returns the roll of the drone
* `drone.get_pitch()` - Returns the pitch of the drone
* `drone.get_yaw()` - Returns the yaw of the drone
* `drone.set_cmd_vel(vx, vy, vz, az)` - Commands the linear velocity of the drone in the x, y and z directions and the angular velocity in z in its body fixed frame
